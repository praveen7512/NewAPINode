## Description

This project is a backend API built with Node.js and Express, designed to provide a robust foundation for web applications. It includes features such as authentication, CRUD operations, email communication, caching, rate limiting, logging, data validation, and more. PostgreSQL is used as the database backend, with Prisma ORM for simplified data access. Redis is utilized for caching, while BullMQ ensures reliable email delivery. Winston is employed for logging, and Vine is used for data validation.

## Features

- Authentication routes (`/api/login`, `/api/auth/register`) to secure the application.
- CRUD functionality for seamless data management.
- Integration with Nodemailer for efficient email communication.
- Redis caching for lightning-fast data retrieval.
- API rate limiter to ensure smooth performance under heavy traffic.
- Prisma ORM for simplified database interactions.
- Winston for comprehensive logging and error handling.
- Vine for robust data validation.
- BullMQ for reliable email delivery.

## Usage
- Register users: POST /api/auth/register
- Log in: POST /api/login
- Perform CRUD operations on data: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests to appropriate endpoints.
- Customize and extend functionality as needed.
